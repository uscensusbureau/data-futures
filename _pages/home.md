<h1 class="site-page-title">Introducing Data Futures</h1>
<p class="site-page-subtitle"><em>A crowdsourcing platform for federal employees @ the Census Bureau.</em></p>
<p>
	The Data Futures pilot is a new way to invest in innovation, transformation, and modernization at the U.S. Census Bureau. Using a phase-based project approach, our goal is to produce results-driven funding for data innovation projects with clear deliverables at every step of the process.

	<h2>1Ô∏è‚É£ How it Works</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>‚úÖ Census Bureau staff <strong>submit data innovation ideas</strong>. You only need a few sentences about the idea and some details about yourself to submit.</li>
		<li>‚öñÔ∏è Ideas are <strong>judged by a panel of innovators and technologists</strong> based on the following criteria: Innovation, Impact, Feasibility, Scalability, and Sustainability (more below). </li>
		<li>üí∞ <strong>Winning ideas will receive funding</strong> and a project investigation team will be assembled to research the idea. This team will produce a report on the feasibility of the project determine if more funding is needed for additional research and prototyping.</li>

	<h2>3Ô∏è‚É£ Pilot Details</h2>
	<h3>üîé What does a great pitch look like?</h3>
	<p>
		A great pitch describes the severity of a data innovation challenge and speaks to the potential impact
		of solving for it. Here‚Äôs an example of the kind of pitch we‚Äôre looking for:
	</p>
	<div class="example-pitch">
		<h4>Reducing the Burden of Data Sharing</h4>
		<h5>Challenge Statement</h5>
		<p>
			Data sharing agreements take 6 months on average to execute, assuming there are no significant legal 
			or policy constraints to navigate. These agreements often delay projects that can produce meaningful 
			statistical insights about our population and consume valuable time of federal staff to craft. 
		</p>
		<h5>Impact Statement</h5>
		<p>
			By exploring technologies that minimize the complexity of data sharing agreements and promote 
			data privacy, the Census Bureau can produce new data products with more diverse partners, 
			introduce cost savings in staff time dedicated to crafting data sharing agreements, and produce 
			new insights about our nation‚Äôs population, economy, and beyond.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h3>‚öñÔ∏è Judging Criteria</h3>
	<p>Idea submissions will be judged on the following criteria:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Does the proposal offer a new and creative solution to a specific government challenge?</li>
		<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Will the proposal have a measurable positive impact on government efficiency, effectiveness, or cost-effectiveness, as well as on citizens and stakeholders?</li>
		<li><strong>Feasibility:</strong> Is the proposal feasible within the government's policies, regulations, and resources?</li>
		<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Does the proposal have the potential to be scaled and replicated across different programs or other federal agencies?</li>
		<li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Does the proposal indicate what programs, areas, or offices would manage a potential solution? Is there reason to believe funds can be obtained to support this solution through its useful life?</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>üöÄ Information for Project Teams</h3>
	<p>Project investigation teams will be made up of 3-4 <em>federal employees</em>. Our hope is for these individuals to have a diverse range of skills and experience and to encourage representation from multiple directorates. Individuals selected to participate in these teams will be given <strong>additional details upon selection</strong>, such as key documents, <em>a charge code for timekeeping</em>, and guidance from the Data Futures team on the kinds of things we‚Äôre hoping to learn in this pilot about the selected ideas.</p>
