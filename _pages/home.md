<h1 class="site-page-title">Introducing Data Futures</h1>
<p class="site-page-subtitle"><em>A crowdsourcing platform for federal employees @ the Census Bureau.</em></p>
<p>
	The Data Futures pilot is a new way to invest in innovation, transformation, and modernization at the U.S. Census Bureau. Using a phase-based approach, our goal is to produce results-driven funding for data innovation projects with clear deliverables at every step of the process.

	<h2>3Ô∏è‚É£ Pilot Details</h2>
	<h3>‚öñÔ∏è Judging Criteria</h3>
	<p>Idea submissions will be judged on the following criteria:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Does the proposal offer a new and creative solution to a specific government challenge?</li>
		<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Will the proposal have a measurable positive impact on government efficiency, effectiveness, or cost-effectiveness, as well as on citizens and stakeholders?</li>
		<li><strong>Feasibility:</strong> Is the proposal feasible within the government's policies, regulations, and resources?</li>
		<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Does the proposal have the potential to be scaled and replicated across different programs or other federal agencies?</li>
		<li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Does the proposal indicate what programs, areas, or offices would manage a potential solution? Is there reason to believe funds can be obtained to support this solution through its useful life?</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>üöÄ Information for Project Teams</h3>
	<p>Project investigation teams will be made up of 3-4 <em>federal employees</em>. Our hope is for these individuals to have a diverse range of skills and experience and to encourage representation from multiple directorates. Individuals selected to participate in these teams will be given <strong>additional details upon selection</strong>, such as key documents, <em>a charge code for timekeeping</em>, and guidance from the Data Futures team on the kinds of things we‚Äôre hoping to learn in this pilot about the selected ideas.</p>
